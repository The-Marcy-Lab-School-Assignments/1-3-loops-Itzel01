# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
We could stop the loop at 7 since the code is saying to break out of the other for loop after a number is greater than 7 so 7 is our stopping point. 

```js
for(let i = 0; i <=7; i++){
  console.log(i)
}
```
